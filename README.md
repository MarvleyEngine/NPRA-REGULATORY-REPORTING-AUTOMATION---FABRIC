# NPRA Monthly Regulatory Reporting Automation (Microsoft Fabric)

## Overview
This project automates the monthly regulatory reporting process for NPRA using Microsoft Fabric. It ingests large monthly datasets, transforms them, stores structured outputs, and supports reporting via SQL views and warehouse queries.

## Architecture Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Monthly files (80–110MB) are received from BTS and placed in a shared folder.
   - Files are moved into a Fabric Lakehouse for processing.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - A Fabric Notebook performs data cleaning, validation, and transformation.

3. **Data Storage**
   - Transformed data is written into a Fabric Warehouse for structured querying.

4. **Reporting Layer**
   - Predefined SQL views are created for reporting needs.
   - Query the warehouse directly to extract regulatory report data.

5. **Automation & Notifications**
   - Pipeline sends email notifications upon:
     - Successful completion
     - Failure or error during processing
